# Recommended dotfiles
These are situational or preferential dotfiles.

## Synergy
[Synergy](https://github.com/symless/synergy) is a great keyboard/mouse sharing
utility that allows you to control multiple systems from one keyboard/mouse.
This doesn't allow the other systems to be completely headless - it doesn't
share the display - but it's still really useful.

Included is a an autoload .desktop file to automatically start it each desktop
login session.

## Syntastic
This [vim plugin](https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic) is a great syntax
checker for vim.

## localvimrc
This [vim plugin](https://github.com/embear/vim-localvimrc) allows you to have
project-specific vimrc files, named .lvimrc, that are loaded in order from root
directory down to the current directory.
